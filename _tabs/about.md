My name is Nick and I'm an Engineering Technical Leader at Cisco Systems in Raleigh, NC. I've been fidgeting with computers my whole life and getting paid for it for 15 years. I've dabbled in just about everything from layer 1 to 7 over the years but my focus these days is on cloud architecture, software development, DevOps, IAC, and Kubernetes.

I'm a bit late to the blogging scene (only by about 10 years ðŸ˜œ) and it's likely this is the 10th tech blog you've visited today. However, I hope you'll find something useful here and, if not, at least something interesting.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholascombs/){:target="_blank"} and make sure to mention you found me from my blog.
